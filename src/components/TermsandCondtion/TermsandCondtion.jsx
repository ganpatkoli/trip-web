          Welcome to SafarMantra. By using our website and services, you agree to follow the rules in this agreement. These rules are here to protect you, our travel agents, and us. If you don't agree with these terms, please do not use our website.

        <p className="section-paragraph">
          SafarMantra is a platform. We are like a trusted marketplace. We connect you, the traveler, with local travel agents who offer unique trips. When you book a trip, you are entering a direct agreement with the agent. SafarMantra is not the travel provider.

        <h2 className="section-headline">5. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
        <p className="section-paragraph">
          Each trip has its own cancellation policy set by the local agent. You must read and understand this policy before you book. SafarMantra cannot guarantee a refund if you cancel your trip, as it depends on the agentâ€™s specific rules. If you have an issue with a refund, we will do our best to help you work with the agent.
